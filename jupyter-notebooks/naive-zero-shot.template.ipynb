    "Background\n",
    "A primary barrier to the widespread adoption of clean hydrogen fuel storage is discovering a practical material for Hydrogen Energy Devices. At the current rate of materials science advancement, some experts project that the discovery and adoption of requisite advanced materials such as catalysts and membrane materials could take until 2050. However, climate change and pollution are occurring rapidly, so it is critical to accelerate this R&D timeframe to 2035. The most significant barrier to accelerating this timeframe is the quantity of researcher toil required per cycle of advanced materials science (AES) experiments. The primary root cause of researcher toil is the human-inaccessibility of experimental data from applied energy materials research. This inaccessibility exists because no widely adopted ontology exists for applied energy materials research. Thus, experimental data is stored heterogeneously, effectively siloed data between scientific domains and individual labs. To overcome this, material scientists must manually de-silo from tens of millions of data points about materials and fabrication methods, drastically slowing down applied materials research. Due to intractable issues such as lab researcher turnover, we presume that AES data will remain heterogeneous without Practical Automated Ontologization for AES Heterogeneous Experimental Data (HED).\n",

    "Forschungszentrum Jülich Department of AI and Data Analytics for Integrated Clean Energy Technologies seeks research advancements to commercialize practical, clean hydrogen fuel storage. ValuestreamAI seeks a challenging, impactful engineering problem to solve.\n",
    "Programming Competition Venue & Scope\n",
    "The ValuestreamAI team will compete in the 2023 Samsung Gen AI programming competition in San Francisco.  The team comprises three engineers and one technical business analyst. Approximately one week of engineering preparation work is done prior to the competition. The competition is approximately ten hours of execution time. Thus, the scope must be limited while still shipping a usable product.\n",
    "Problem Statement\n",
    "Automate the classification of non-standardized CSV headers to Node Labels compliant with the Proposed EMMO Extension Ontology for Hydrogen Energy Conversion Materials Science. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Selection Rationale\n",
    "Header Classification to Node Label was chosen because it is a microcosm of the AES HED problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was selected using the following process:\n",
    "1. The Client research team presented several relevant research problems. \n",
    "2. Sort by urgency to solve\n",
    "3. Tie-break by the impact of solving\n",
    "4. Filter by:\n",
    "   1. Estimated analysis scope under 70 hours\n",
    "   2. Estimated implementation scope under 30 hours\n",

    "KPIs\n",
    "ValuestreamAI seeks to choose KPIs that are an accurate proxy for implementing Practical Automated Ontologization for AES HED. The following KPIs were chosen:\n",
    "\n",

    "Precision\n",
    "\tPrecision of the classifier is paramount because a human user will distrust the inference system if they feel they cannot trust positive inferences\n",

    "\t  \n",
    "\n",
    "\tRuntime Cost Per Million Rows\n",
    "\tDetermines the ongoing per-unit cost of testing and using the inference pipeline\n",
    "\tR&D Costs\n",
    "\tThe upfront costs. There should be an attainable cost curve for achieving useful milestones.\n",
    "\tLicensing Costs\n",
    "\tCosts related to licensing technology\n",
    "\tSuitability for On-prem Cluster\n",
    "\tHow compatible is the solution with the client research team's compute cluster?\n",

    "\tClient Satisfaction\n",
    "\tDoes the deliverable satisfy its intended purpose?\n",
    "\tSolution Constraints\n",

    "* Represent the larger problem of Practical Automated Ontologization for AES HED\n",
    "* Plausibly scale to reduce a top category of researcher toil by at least 90%\n",
    "* Be adaptable to support high-quality integration with neo4j and VIMI\n",
    "________________\n",
    "Hackathon Proposed Deliverables\n",

    "\tWorkflows\n",
    "\tEnglish instructions and Linux scripts documenting how to reproduce or extend the experiments delivered.\n",
    "\tLive Training Recording\n",
    "\tUp to three hours of recorded live sessions for the client research team for training and analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "The deliverable will have the following attributes: 1. Complementary to existing work, 2. MIT license, 3. High standard of readability\n",
    "Payment Terms\n",
    "ValuestreamAI requests payment only if the deliverable meets or exceeds the client research team's expectations. Payment shall be due NET60 from the day of invoice to the client research team. The requested payment amount is the approximate cost of competition preparation and travel expenses, CAD$4000. Engineering hours are granted pro bono for this project.\n",
